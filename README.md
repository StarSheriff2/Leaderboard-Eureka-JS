The leaderboard app displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. The app consumes data stored in an external **API** service located [here](https://www.notion.so/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3).

> I built the app using **webpack** and **ES6** features, such as **modules**.

### About the API
- This app consumes a public API located at https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/
- The API allows the following calls:
  - Create new game at endpoint `/games/`
  - Submit a new score at endpoint `/games/:id/scores/`
  - Get latest scores from `/games/:id/scores/`
- The API calls are made according to its documentation, which can be accessed [here](https://www.notion.so/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3)
