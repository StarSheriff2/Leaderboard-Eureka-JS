The leaderboard app displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard **API** service.

> I built the app using **webpack** and **ES6** features, such as **modules**.

I built this project using webpack and Vanilla JS. I implemented asynchronous code through **async** and **await** to load scores from the API. The page is fully responsive.

Features:
- Submit a new score to the leaderboard API
- Get latest scores
- See scores by highest score
